### Linear Rail System Project Report

#### Introduction
This report provides an overview of the newly designed linear rail system, focusing on its key components, operational flow, and specific technical considerations. The system utilizes a Raspberry Pi (RasPi) interfaced with an Arduino to control a stepper motor via a stepper driver. The integration is achieved through a Flask web application, which serves as the command and control interface. The linear motion is restricted and calibrated by switches located at both ends of the rail.

#### System Overview
The linear rail system operates by coordinating several hardware components through software control, enabling precise linear movement for various applications such as automation and robotics. Below is a detailed description of the components and their interconnectivity.

##### Components:
- **Raspberry Pi**: Acts as the central control unit running Flask to manage the web interface and handle the logical operations.
- **Arduino**: Interfaces with the stepper motor driver, receiving signals from the Raspberry Pi to control the motor's movements.
- **Stepper Motor Driver**: Receives signals from the Arduino to drive the stepper motor accordingly.
- **Stepper Motor**: Provides the actual linear motion along the rail.
- **Limit Switches**: Located at both ends of the rail, these switches provide boundary limits and calibration points for the motor's movement.

#### Connectivity and Control Flow
1. **Flask Application**: Hosted on the Raspberry Pi, it provides a user interface to control the stepper motor's position and receives user inputs for movement commands.
2. **Signal Transmission**: When a command is issued via Flask, the Raspberry Pi sends the appropriate signals to the Arduino.
3. **Arduino Programming**: Upon startup, the Raspberry Pi automatically flashes the Arduino with the necessary code to interpret and relay commands to the stepper motor driver.
4. **Stepper Driver Activation**: The Arduino processes commands and transmits them as voltage signals to the stepper motor driver, which then controls the motor’s movements.
5. **Calibration and Safety**: The limit switches are engaged to prevent the stepper motor from moving beyond the designated rail length, providing a safety cutoff and allowing for system recalibration.

#### Technical Considerations
- **Voltage Compatibility**: The Arduino GPIO outputs a maximum of 3V, insufficient for the stepper driver that requires a minimum input of 4.5V. To address this, the following solutions are considered:
  - **Use of a MOSFET**: A MOSFET can be used to boost the 3V output from the Arduino to a higher voltage suitable for the stepper driver.
  - **Direct Raspberry Pi GPIO Control**: Alternatively, leveraging the Raspberry Pi’s GPIO, which can output a higher voltage, may eliminate the need for additional components like a MOSFET.

#### Conclusion
The linear rail system effectively integrates multiple technologies to achieve precise control over stepper motor-driven linear motion. By using a Flask application hosted on a Raspberry Pi and interfacing with an Arduino, the system provides a versatile and scalable solution for various linear motion applications. However, attention must be paid to voltage compatibility between the Arduino and the stepper driver to ensure reliable operation. Future improvements might include more robust voltage conversion solutions or direct integration of higher voltage GPIO options.
